      <p>Hi,</p>

      <p>A couple of weeks ago we asked you for feedback on whether you felt we’d helped you win business in \{{win.country.name}}.</p>

      <p>
        We use this information to help us understand whether our services are good value for UK taxpayers. We also use it to help us improve the support we give to businesses, so it’s really important we get your feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should take you less than 5 minutes to confirm the details of your export win and how we helped you.
